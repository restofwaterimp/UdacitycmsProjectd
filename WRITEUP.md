### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
My Answer

I will select App Service.

VMs seem to be easier in terms of cost, but the features of this application are such that it is unlikely to stop the service. Therefore, the cost aspect remains the same even if I choose the APP Service.
Also, we do not envision that much scalability in the future. Since it is possible to scale up or scale out within a certain range, there is no difference between the two.

Both VM and AppService can be configured for redundancy, so there is no difference.

App Service is better because you don't have to worry about the infrastructure. App Service is superior to VM in order not to reduce the speed of future development.



### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
